## ⚡ Robot Features & Innovations

Our sumo robot was designed to maximize performance in the competition while respecting the rules:

- **High-Torque DC Motors** for strong pushing power.  
- **VL53L0X Lidar Sensors** for precise 3D distance measurements and opponent tracking.  
- **TCRT-5000 IR Sensors** for edge/line detection to avoid leaving the dohyo.  
- **Autonomous Operation** for independent movement during bouts.  
- **Safety & Stability Design** to prevent tipping or detachment of parts.  
- **BTS7960 Motor Drivers** for controlling high-current motors.  
- **LiPo Battery Pack (3S)** for sufficient power supply.  
- **LM2596 Buck Converters** to provide stable voltage to sensors and controller.  
- **User Interface Buttons and Buzzer** for pre-match setup and notifications.
